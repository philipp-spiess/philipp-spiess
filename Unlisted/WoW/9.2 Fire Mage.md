## Rotation Notes
- SKB
	- You should begin pooling Fire Blast charges at 7 stacks of Sun Kingâ€™s Blessing.
	-  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_mage_runeofpower.gif) Rune of Power](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116011/rune-of-power) should only be used with  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mage_firestarter.gif) Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=333313/sun-kings-blessing). You can use  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_mage_runeofpower.gif) Rune of Power](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116011/rune-of-power) before you have a proc built up since  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mage_firestarter.gif) Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=333313/sun-kings-blessing) only lasts 6 seconds. **6+ stacks is recommended**.
	- Advanced
		- Night Fae Mages use Shifting Power when close enough to the target during Combustion if there are both not enough charges available to fully extend Infernal Cascade and will not be ready immediately after Combustion ends. When using Shifting Power during Combustion, generate and spend Hot Streaks by using all Fire Blast charges and one Phoenix Flames charge first. It should also not be used during Combustion when Firestarter is active.
		- If Rune of Power would be ready after Combustion and you have several stacks already, it can be beneficial to `/cancelaura Sun King's Blessing` before Combustion so that the Sun King's Blessing proc earned during Combustion can be used with that Rune of Power instead of using it during  Combustion.
	- 4p changes
		-  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_mage_kindling.gif) Kindling](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=155148/kindling) is recommended once you have this 4p tier bonus, unless the fight time is better suited for  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shaman_lavasurge.gif) Pyroclasm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=269650/pyroclasm).
		- You no longer need to hold on to 3  ![Phoenix Flames Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/artifactability_firemage_phoenixbolt.jpg) [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/257541) stacks for  ![Combustion Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_fire_sealoffire.jpg) [Combustion](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/190319). The 4-set bonus gives you so many  ![Fire Blast Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_fire_fireball.jpg) [Fire Blast](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/319836) charges that you generally will only need a single Phoenix Flames for Combustion, which will come naturally due to the sped up recharge time
