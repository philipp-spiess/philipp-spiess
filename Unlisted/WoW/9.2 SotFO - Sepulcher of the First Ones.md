![Sepulcher of the first ones boss order](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1052495.png)

## [1. Vigilant Guardian](https://mythictrap.com/sepulcher/vigilantGuardian/heroic/none)
- Dodge stuff on the ground
	- Especially the floating orbs since they will snare and debuff 
- Run out with arrow
- When boss casts big badaboom stand in adds safe area
- Throw orbs at the boss to spawn the big boss
- Burn in P3 (<15% HP)
## [2. Skolex, the Insatiable Ravener](https://mythictrap.com/sepulcher/skolex)
- Big giant wormy boss with forced downtime (better not play frost mage here).
- Dodge sketchy frontal (Retch)
- Gives out Ephemera Dust DoT to everyone periodically
- Worm goes digging when the whole raid stacks
	- This resets all DoTs
	- But gives a permanent 5% damage done debuff
- 3 furtherst players bait Dust Blast projectile (which hit in 10yd)
	- If assigned, be far away and spread
	- Gain more DoTs
## [3. Artificer Xy'mox](https://mythictrap.com/sepulcher/xymox)
- Rings are expanding from the artifact or being pulled into it.
- Drop one portal in the middle, one at the corner.
- Use the teleporter (or blink/alter time) to avoid getting hit & one-shot
- Stand out of traps or Robert has to help you out.
- Chain-lightning: Spread and wait it out. Like COVID.
- Add phase: 
	- Kick stuff and nuke
	- Xy Acolyte > Xy Spellsinger
